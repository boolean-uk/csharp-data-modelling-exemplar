# C# Data Modelling Exercise

## Learning Objectives
- Explain that an Entity Relationship Diagram is used to visualise and define the implementation of a database
- Use user stories to design conceptual data models
- Use conceptual data models to design logical data models
- Use logical data models to design physical data models

## Instructions

Fork the repo as normal.

Create the Entity-Relationship Diagrams using whichever tool you feel works best for you.

Once you have a solution for each activity add it to this repo as an image.

Push your repo once you have completed the activities and create a Pull Request as normal.

## Core Exercise - Hotel Booking System

#### Epic

”A local hotel wants to keep a record of room bookings. The hotel has a lot of rooms, but customers will only be able to choose one room per booking. The person who books the room is not necessarily the person providing contact details.”

#### User Stories
- As a customer, so I can have a place to stay tomorrow night, I want to book a room at the hotel.
- As the hotel owner, so I can expand my business, I want to add new rooms to the hotel.

Design a simplified booking system for this epic.

## Extension Exercises

Come up with User Stories (and possibly a more detailed Epic) for each of the following scenarios. 

Then design the database tables and relationships which would be needed to implement them.

1. A local candle maker wants to open an online store selling their handmade candles and other artifacts, they need a database system to use as part of this online shop. Details of customers need to be stored, products need to be stored and updated, a record of customer orders also needs to be maintained. Design the database system for the Candle Shop.

2. A restaurant wants to introduce an online booking system for their main dining room, which has various tables. The restaurant is open throughout the day so customers can book for a variety of times.

3. A University library wishes to implement an online system for borrowing books and other items from the library. Each user will be able to borrow up to 6 items at a time.

4. When they originally launched Social Media sites such as Twitter, Identica, Diaspora and Mastodon all described themselves as micro-blogging sites, design a database schema for a similar micro-blogging Social Media site.

5. Think about an online learning system as used by a school, a university or a coding bootcamp, design the database tables etc that might be required to implement such a system.
